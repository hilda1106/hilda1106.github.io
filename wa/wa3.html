            <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p> <strong> Formula One,</strong> commonly abbreviated as <strong> F1, </strong>is the highest class of international racing for open-wheel single-seater formula racing cars sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). 
                    The <strong>FIA Formula One World Championship</strong> has been one of the world's premier forms of motorsport since its inaugural running in 1950 and is often considered to be the pinnacle of motorsport. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The word <em><strong>formula</strong></em> in the name refers to the set of rules all participants' cars must follow. 
                    A Formula One season consists of a series of races, known as <strong> Grand Prix.</strong>
                    Grands Prix take place in multiple countries and continents on either purpose-built circuits or closed roads. A point-system is used at Grands Prix to determine two annual <strong> World Championships: one for the drivers, and one for the constructors.</strong>
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Formula One cars are the <strong>world's fastest regulated road-course racing cars, </strong> owing to high cornering speeds achieved by generating large amounts of aerodynamic downforce, much of which is generated by front and rear wings, as well as underbody tunnels. 

                </p>
                <p>                
                    The first world championship race, the 1950 British Grand Prix, took place at Silverstone Circuit in the United Kingdom on May 13, 1950. Giuseppe Farina, competing for Alfa Romeo, won the first Driver’ World Championship, narrowly defeating his teammate Juan Manuel Fangio.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    The current Formula One grid consists of <strong> 10 teams, </strong> each fielding <strong> two drivers, </strong> making a total of 20 drivers competing in the championship. 
                    Each team operates as a constructor, designing and developing their own car within the regulations set by the FIA. Each driver competes for individual success in the Drivers' Championship, while their combined performances contribute to their team’s standing in the Constructors' Championship.
