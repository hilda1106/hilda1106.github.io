            <h2>Overview</h2>           
            <p> <strong> Formula One,</strong> commonly abbreviated as <strong> F1, </strong>is the highest class of international racing for open-wheel single-seater formula racing cars sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). 
                The <strong>FIA Formula One World Championship</strong> has been one of the world's premier forms of motorsport since its inaugural running in 1950 and is often considered to be the pinnacle of motorsport. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The word <em><strong>formula</strong></em> in the name refers to the set of rules all participants' cars must follow. 
                A Formula One season consists of a series of races, known as <strong> Grand Prix.</strong>
                Grands Prix take place in multiple countries and continents on either purpose-built circuits or closed roads. A point-system is used at Grands Prix to determine two annual <strong> World Championships: one for the drivers, and one for the constructors.</strong>
            </p>
            <p> 
                Formula One cars are the <strong>world's fastest regulated road-course racing cars, </strong> owing to high cornering speeds achieved by generating large amounts of aerodynamic downforce, much of which is generated by front and rear wings, as well as underbody tunnels. 

            </p>
            <p>                
                The first world championship race, the 1950 British Grand Prix, took place at Silverstone Circuit in the United Kingdom on May 13, 1950. Giuseppe Farina, competing for Alfa Romeo, won the first Driver’ World Championship, narrowly defeating his teammate Juan Manuel Fangio.
            </p>
            <p> 
                The current Formula One grid consists of <strong> 10 teams, </strong> each fielding <strong> two drivers, </strong> making a total of 20 drivers competing in the championship. 
                Each team operates as a constructor, designing and developing their own car within the regulations set by the FIA. Each driver competes for individual success in the Drivers' Championship, while their combined performances contribute to their team’s standing in the Constructors' Championship.

            <h2>Racing Weekend</h2>
            <p> A Formula One Grand Prix event spans a weekend. It typically begins with two free practice sessions on Friday, and one free practice session on Saturday. 
                Additional drivers (commonly known as third drivers) are allowed to run on Fridays, but only two cars may be used per team, requiring a race driver to give up their seat. 
                A qualifying session is held after the last free practice session. This session determines the starting order for the race on Sunday
            </p>
    </div>
    <div id = "Circuit"> 
        <h2>Circuit</h2>
            <p> Formula One races must be held on Grade One tracks, the highest grade-rating issued by the FIA for tracks. The layout and lap distance of each circuit can vary significantly as long as they stay within the FIA's regulations. In most cases, the tracks run in a clockwise direction, although there are a handful of tracks in the Championship that run anticlockwise.
                </p>
    </div>
    <div id = "Race"> 
        <h2>Race</h2>
            <p> The race begins with a warm-up lap, after which the cars assemble on the starting grid in the order they qualified. This lap is often referred to as the formation lap, as the cars lap in formation with no overtaking (although a driver who makes a mistake may regain lost ground). 
                The warm-up lap allows drivers to check the condition of the track and their car, gives the tyres a chance to warm up to increase traction and grip, and also gives the pit crews time to clear themselves and their equipment from the grid for the race start.
                Once all the cars have formed on the grid, after the medical car positions itself behind the pack, a light system above the track indicates the start of the race: five red lights are illuminated at intervals of one second; they are all then extinguished simultaneously after an unspecified time (typically less than 3 seconds) to signal the start of the race. <br>
                <br>
                Under normal circumstances, the winner of the race is the first driver to cross the finish line having completed a set number of laps.
